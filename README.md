# RC Files

In the footsteps of others, I have decided to start managing my rc or dotfiles so
I can easily rebuild my environment.

This repo includes `vim` with [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
[Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) installed, along with my `.gitconfig`,
`tmux.conf` and `.bashrc` files, etc. It also contains a few setup scripts that helps
me install what I need on new machines very quickly. It may not necessarily apply to
your environment so please use it at your own risk.


# Dependencies

Best to run with the following installed:
  * VIM 8.2
  * NodeJS with yarn (via npm)
